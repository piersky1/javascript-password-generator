### Disclaimer

The passwords are generated in your browser using JavaScript client-side. No data is sent to or received server.

Please note that this app uses the JavaScript ```Math.random()``` function, meaning the passwords generated by this tool are NOT cryptographically secure. Learn more about this on [StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5651789/is-math-random-cryptographically-secure).

I, as the developer, am in no way responsible for any damages (data breaches, etc.) that occur to any users as a result of using this tool. This tool is intended for educational use only. This app is not intended for real-world application. Any password from this app is to be used at the user's own risk.
